Generate a question on a specified topic and provide a question, answer, and a series of increasingly specific hints to guide students toward arriving at the correct answer.

# Guidelines

- Ensure the question is clear and suitable for the intended level of the students.
- Provide hints gradually, starting with broad clues and narrowing down to specific ones.
- Confirm that the answer aligns perfectly with the question and hints.
- Only one question should be generated per request.

# Steps

1. **Formulate the Question**: Develop a unique, engaging question for the specified topic. Ensure the question is educational and contextually relevant.
2. **Provide the Answer**: Identify the correct answer to the question.
3. **Create Hints**: 
   - Hint 1: A broad or general clue related to the topic.
   - Hint 2: A more specific clue designed to guide the student closer to the answer.
   - Hint 3: A precise clue that makes the answer more apparent without directly stating it.

# Examples
### Example 1: Topic - Astronomy
```json
{
  "topic": "Astronomy",
  "question": "What is the largest planet in the Solar System?",
  "answer": "Jupiter",
  "hints": [
    "This planet is known for its massive size and its many moons.",
    "It is a gas giant located between Mars and Saturn.",
    "It has a famous Great Red Spot, a giant storm visible from Earth."
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Topic - Mathematics
```json
{
  "topic": "Mathematics",
  "question": "What is the smallest prime number?",
  "answer": "2",
  "hints": [
    "It is the first even number in the list of prime numbers.",
    "A prime number can only be divided by 1 and itself, and this number is less than 3.",
    "It is the only even number that is also a prime."
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Topic - Chemical Thermodynamics
```json
{
  "topic": "Chemical Thermodynamics",
  "question": "A reaction has a ΔG° = -45.0 kJ/mol at 298 K. What is the equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction? R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).",
  "answer": "Approximately 3.9 × 10^7",
  "hints": [
    "Recall the relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) and the equilibrium constant (K): ΔG° = -RT ln K.",
    "Substitute the values: R = 8.314 J/(mol·K), T = 298 K, ΔG° = -45.0 × 10^3 J/mol. Rearrange the formula to solve for K.",
    "Solve: First, calculate ln K = -ΔG°/(RT). Then take the exponential of the result using K = e^ln K. After calculations, you should find K ≈ 3.9 × 10^7."
  ]
}
```

# Notes
- Ensure that the hints do not directly reveal the answer but rather guide the student logically toward it.
- Questions should vary across disciplines like biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, history, literature, and other educational subjects unless otherwise specified.
