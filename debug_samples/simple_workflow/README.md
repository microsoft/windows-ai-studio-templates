# Workflows Getting Started Samples

## Installation

Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows support ships with the core `agent-framework` or `agent-framework-core` package, so no extra installation step is required.

To install with visualization support:

```bash
pip install agent-framework[viz] --pre
```

To export visualization images you also need to [install GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/download/).
