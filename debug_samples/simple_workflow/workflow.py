"""
Sample: Agents in a workflow with streaming

A Writer agent generates content, then a Reviewer agent critiques it.
The workflow uses streaming so you can observe incremental AgentRunUpdateEvent chunks as each agent produces tokens.

Purpose:
Show how to wire chat agents into a WorkflowBuilder pipeline by adding agents directly as edges.

Demonstrate:
- Automatic streaming of agent deltas via AgentRunUpdateEvent when using run_stream().
- Agents adapt to workflow mode: run_stream() emits incremental updates, run() emits complete responses.

Prerequisites:
- Azure AI Agent Service configured, along with the required environment variables.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, edges, events, and streaming runs.
